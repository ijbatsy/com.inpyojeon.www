<h1>About</h1>
<div class="inner abo">
	<p>I started my career as a web frontend developer in 2012 while majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University of Technology(Seoultech). After graduation, I worked for several large companies, including Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency(KOTRA) and Hyundai Home Shopping Network.<br><br>
	I won Nomad Hackathon Seoul and acquired MCSD in 2018 before becoming a English-Korean translator as I was fed up with programming. Since then, I have translated Mojang's Minecraft Woodsword Chronicles and a couple of IT books published by O'Reilly as well as comic books by Marvel and DC Comics.<br><br>
	When I wasn't working, I usually spent time repainting 1/6 action figures or writing short stories. Most of them were related to Batman because I love him more than anything and my dream came true at the end of 2019 by writing my first graphic novel, <i>Batman: Saha</i>. It was drawn by a promising BD artist, Jaekwang Park(<i>Conan</i>).<br><br>
